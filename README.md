# COVID event application
## Introduction

This app is a realtime social platform that joins people together based on the events(social gatherings) they attended. A user needs to signup/log in through email(with verification over mail). Any event organizer can create a closed group of attendees in the event and people can view their respective attended events on the app. This group must contain at least a minimum of 5 people for the organizer to create an event. And the event is automatically removed after 14-15 days as it usually takes around 14 days to show the symptoms of coronavirus. Any user who confirms COVID19 +ve can trigger an alarm present in the app. All the people sharing the same group with that person will be alarmed and further people with 2nd-degree contact will also be alarmed.

## Implementation 

The application is built entirely in Android Studio supported by JAVA and front-hand UI is expressed in XML. The app has been integrated with the real-time database and user authentication through GCP Firebase API. App has been built with necessary toast messages, dialog boxes, spinners and error handlers wherever necessary.
